It all started with the games Red and Blue versions for Game Boy and its popularity sky-rocketed. Soon, the franchise expanded to an anime<img width="125" height="125" alt="pokemon-anime-preview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3c528fe-c90a-4f69-93b4-f32b5ec4cb57" />
, manga<img width="125" height="125" alt="pokemon-adventures-preview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ebba61b3-0d76-42de-8bd0-edafa8c43f80" />
 and also a Trading Card Game <img width="125" height="125" alt="pokemon-tcg-preview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7f709c03-380d-4c40-8341-05d5d60ed1b7" />




Despite the name having Trading, it is also used for battles with each Pokémon having an HP (Health Point), attack(s) and/or an ability.

My project is to reunite some of these TCG cards with arts that I like the most for each set launched.

Some examples are:

These cards will DEFINITELY be displayed when their set come.

This project IS NOT a catalog of how many cards there are on each set. This is just my personal favorite arts with my own taste.
